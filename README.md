# Student_placement_prediction
My latest Machine Learning projectâ€”a student placement prediction challenge from Kaggle. This project allowed me to dive deep into classification techniques and refine my approach. 
Data source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ruchikakumbhar/placement-prediction-dataset

Here's how I tackled it:

ðŸ”¹ Part 1: Data Loading & Analysis
           Imported and explored the dataset
           Conducted statistical analysis
           Visualized key insights
ðŸ”¹ Part 2: Data Preprocessing
           Handled outliers and encoded categorical features
           Split data into training and test sets
           Scaled features for better model performance
ðŸ”¹ Part 3: Modeling & Evaluation
           Tested various classifiers to find the best-performing model
           Tuned hyperparameters for optimization
           Applied cross-validation and evaluated results using a confusion matrix
